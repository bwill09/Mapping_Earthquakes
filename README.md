# Mapping_Earthquakes

### project Overview 
The intent of the project is to visualize the difference between the magnitude of earthquakes globally within the last week. To complete this task, it'll require the use of URL, for GeoJSON earthquakes data pulled USGS website and receive geographical coordinated and maginitudes of earthquakes for the last week, and display the data to a map. JavaScript and the D3.js libary to retrive the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. The Leaflet libary would be used to plot on the Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquakes data.
